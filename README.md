AI systems are largely used to perform profiling and they are getting better at it. It is even claimed that in the near future, users will not only be reading their e-readers; rather their ereader will be reading the users. In a similar vein, criminality rates could be largely reduced through predictive policing.  
In this work, we identify legal, technical and ethical issues raised by profiling, and are encouraged to propose solutions to (some of) these challenges.
